        I'm currently pursuing undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan.
        A majority of the coursework and projects that I have created are written in C++,
        but I have worked in other languages such as Python and Javascript. I have 
        a working knowledge of Java and C# but the language I am the most fluent in is C++.<br><br>
        I am also involved in the Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP) at the Univeristy
        of Michigan. I work under my mentor Patrick Grim, a professor in residence
        at the Center of the Study of Complex Systems. The research that our team is working is based in
        the use of Bayesian Nets as respresentations of a probabilistic model for belief networks.

        please take a look at my projects page.<br>
