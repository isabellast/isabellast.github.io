                     without exceding the individual's anger level. Each person is generated on a specific floor
                      of the building and the user's input is parsed and executed according to the possible moves within the game.

                 <li>Puzzle Solver | C++</li>
                 <p>A puzzle solver using a backtracking algorithm with two modes, stack and queue.
                     Returns the solution to a given map under the constaints of the the actual map rules, if one is found.
                     If no solution is found the program returns the reachable areas on a given map.

                 <li>Stock Stimulator | C++</li>
                 <p>A Stock stimulation program with a time traveler feature. The program processes orders as they are
                     received. Buying and selling between traders happen based off of the program's critiera for trades.
                     The trades are output as they take place and the numer of trade orders processed are output at the end
                     of the trades on file. If time traveler mode is invoked,
                     it calculates which trades would have created the most profit for each trader
                     and reports this at the end of the program.
